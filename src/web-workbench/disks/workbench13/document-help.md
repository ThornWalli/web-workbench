# Help for Document Editor / Reader

## How do I create a document?

1. open the `Document Editor`

2. Under `Document Settings` in the menu bar, define your output format.

3. Now you can write the document in the specified syntax. For help you can use a 
Preview, this is optional and can be disabled. 

4. When you are finished, you can save your document in the menu bar under `Document Editor -> Save/Save As`.

> **Note:** Be careful how you save your document, HARD/RAM DISK erases itself after the browser cache is empty. Alternatively you can connect to a `Firebase Storage` with the application `Cloud`.
